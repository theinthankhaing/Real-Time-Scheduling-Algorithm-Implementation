# Energy - Efficient Scheduling Algorithm to Reduce CPU Power Consumptions for Periodic Tasks in Real - Time Embedded System

## Project Overview

* Implemented Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (ES - DVFS) and Dynamic Global Energy - Efficent Scheduling Based on the Actual Execution Time (DGAET) by reading papers
* Compared these two algorithms

## Environment SetUp

* Python 3.7
* Visual Studio Code

## Description of Input Data

* As for the input data of both ES – DVFS and DGAET algorithms, three tasks sets with execution time, deadline and period (𝐶𝑖,𝐷𝑖,𝑇𝑖) are asked from the user, where 𝐶𝑖=execution time, 𝐷𝑖 = deadline, 𝑇𝑖 = period and 𝑖 = 3. 
* The execution time must be smaller than both deadline and period, and deadline also must be smaller than period. 
* Therefore, the input task set must be in 𝐶<𝐷<𝑇. 
* Moreover, execution time, deadline and periods of each task must not be same. 
* It is also assumed that all the periods must be in periodically.
